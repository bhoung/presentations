# Overview

- Why Web Scraping

- Parsing HTML

- Downloading Web Pages 

- HTTP 

- REST APIs

- Examples

  a) AFL
  
  b) Reddit
  
  c) Fitness Passport

# Why Learn Web Scraping?

--

- access to data

--

- useful for understanding the web, including for using APIs and building websites / dashboards

--

- have some ready to use examples

# Parsing HTML (1)

Web pages consist of HTML, CSS and Javascript

- Hypertext Markup Language is essentially a series of tags. Roughly similar to latex, xml, json. 

```{html}
    <p> Some paragraph of text </p>
  
    opening tag: <p>

        content between tags: text, numbers, images
  
    closing tag: </p>
```

- Cascading Style Sheets to customise presentation of web page
- Javascript allows for interactivity
  
---

# Parsing HTML (2)

- A typical HTML page structure

```{html} 
<html>

<head>
    <title> title at top of browser  </title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1> Title </h1>
   
   <p> some paragraph of text  </p>

</body>
</html>
```

```{html}
Common tags: 
- list items  <ul> and <li> 
- links <a href="someurl" > click me </a>
- font style bold <b>, <i>
- divs <div> and ids <id> for layouts. e.g 2 columns, menu panels.
attributes <div="a" class="b">
```

# Parsing HTML (3)

Assume that most data we are interested in will be available in table format

```{html}
  <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
           <th> col1 </th>
           <th> col2 <th>
           <th> col3 </th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td> cell 1 </td>
          <td> cell 2 </td>
          <td> cell 3 </td>
        </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
```

Code results in this exciting table: ![table](table.PNG)

# Downloading Web Pages

###wget and curl

wget

```{text}
$ wget http://theage.com.au --no-check-certificate
```

--
recursion, follow links
```{text}
$ wget -r 
```

no parent
```{text}
$ wget -r --no-parent
```
--

wait between retrieval, limit rate
```{text}
$ wget -r --no-parent -w 10 --limit-rate=20k
```

#HTTP (1) 

---
#HTTP (2), requests

- Uniform Resource Locator (URL):

```{text}
protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name 
```

--
- Request - browser translates URL into protocol, sending request to server:

```{text} 
GET /docs/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.nowhere123.com
Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
```
--
---

#HTTP (3), responses

- Response - what is returned from the server
```{text}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:56:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Sat, 20 Nov 2004 07:16:26 GMT
...
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 44
Content-Type: text/html
  
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
```

# Restful APIs (1)

### Representational State Transfer architectural style

### Application Program Interface

--

Standard for how a web server responds in relation to requests (HTTP methodologies defined in RFC 2616 Protocol)

--

HTTP and Restful APIs are stateless, meaning that responses do not track state

--

4 types of requests, 2 of which you need to know:

- GET for retrieving pages. most pages. e.g. return of a list of items

- POST for submitting data, creating a resource through a HTML form. Creating an account, entering details 

```{text}
```

---

# Restful APIs (2)

A useful abstraction of the 4 types of requests is:

Create -> Post

Read   -> Get

Update -> Put

Delete -> Delete

Resulting in another acronym for the common CRUD web apps.

The alternative protocol is Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which strings messages through a sequence of steps (e.g. nodes for addressing, security, format independence)
